Create a Production-Ready Financial Data Platform with AI Integration and Agent-Based Architecture
Design and implement a comprehensive financial data platform with the following components:
Core Requirements:
1. Financial Data API
* Multi-source data aggregation (YFinance, Robin Stocks, Charles Schwab, SoFi, IBKR)
* Intelligent failover and source health monitoring
* Endpoints: quotes, historical prices, technical indicators, portfolio analysis, news, screening, crypto, options
* Real-time WebSocket streaming
* Rate limiting by tier (Basic: 100/min, Premium: 1000/min, Enterprise: 10000/min)
2. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
* Standardized tool definitions with categories (market data, technical analysis, portfolio, news, etc.)
* Parameter validation and type checking
* Tool templates and documentation generation
* News aggregation with timestamp tracking (published_at vs retrieved_at)
3. AI Assistant Integration
* Multiple models: Claude (long analysis), ChatGPT (balanced), Gemini (web/YouTube search), Grok (social sentiment)
* Intelligent model selection based on query type
* Fallback mechanisms between models
* Tool-aware assistants with automatic tool selection
4. Data Management
* Persistence: All downloaded data and user interactions must be logged/persisted
* Caching: Load cache from disk before attempting downloads
* Data Granularity: Download maximum available granularity (1s if available) for entire market hours
* Aggregation: Aggregate to requested period after download
* TimescaleDB: Use for rapid time-series data retrieval and analysis
* Smart Downloads: Only download if data doesn't exist for those market hours
5. Agent-Based Architecture
* Tool Creation Agent: Creates, develops, and debugs MCP tools as needed
* Agent Creation Agent: Creates new agents, generates features, deconflicts with existing agents, writes/tests/debugs code
* Orchestrator Agent: Aware of all agents, routes queries, coordinates agent activities
* Registries: Maintain tool registry and agent registry
* Communication:
   * Asynchronous messaging between User ↔ AI Assistant ↔ Orchestrator ↔ Agents
   * Inter-agent communication as needed
   * Event-driven activation (websocket data, webhooks, messages)
* Tool Awareness: All agents access tools through registry
6. Infrastructure Components
* Advanced caching (Redis + disk, multiple strategies)
* Security middleware (API keys, JWT, rate limiting)
* Monitoring and analytics system
* Database migrations with partitioning
* Docker/Kubernetes deployment configs
* Client SDKs (Python, TypeScript/JavaScript)
7. Example Applications
* Trading bot with technical analysis and AI decisions
* Web dashboard with real-time charts
* Portfolio analyzer
* News monitoring system
Technical Implementation Details:
1. Flask-based API with async support
2. Redis for caching and rate limiting
3. PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
4. WebSocket server for real-time streaming
5. Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
6. OpenAPI specification
7. Comprehensive test suite
Key Features to Emphasize:
1. Production-ready with proper error handling, logging, monitoring
2. Scalable architecture with horizontal scaling support
3. Secure with multiple authentication levels and encryption
4. Intelligent data source routing with automatic failover
5. Efficient with smart caching and data aggregation
6. Extensible through agent and tool creation capabilities
Please provide complete, production-ready code for all components, ensuring the system can handle high-volume requests, provides accurate financial data, and enables sophisticated AI-powered analysis. The agent system should be fully autonomous, capable of extending its own capabilities as needed.
